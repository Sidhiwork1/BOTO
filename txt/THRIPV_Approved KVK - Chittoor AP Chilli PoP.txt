3.
4.
5.
6.

Timely harvests improve quality of chilli
Delayed harvests develop wrinkles on pods due to over ripening
Heap the ripe pods over night to get uniform ripening
Avoid insecticide sprays before picking to prevent pesticide residues
Dry the produce till the moisture reaches 10-11% level
Optimum drying of the harvested chili on polythene sheets or cement floors to prevent
Aflatoxins
7. Keep the produce free from dust and other foreign material while drying to prevent
contamination. Keep the dogs, cats and poultry away from the drying floor
8. Sort out the damaged and white spotted fruits to market the graded quality produce
9. Cold storage retain colour and quality of produce and fetch remunerative price
10. Do not use any chemical for improvement of color like Sudan R-I as they are
hazardous(toxic) and are prohibited for use
11. Do not write with ink on chilli field gunnies to prevent contamation of toxic chemical
Rhodomine B which will be observed by the dried and packed chillies.
